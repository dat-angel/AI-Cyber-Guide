Hello, World!

This repository houses the contents of the The AI Cyber Guide's 2024 Lab Session at RSAC: "LAB2-T01: Set Yourself Up for Success: Build Trust during Incidents by Leveraging AI" presented by [Renana Friedlich ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renana-friedlich-barsky-aa523049/) and [Beatriz Datangel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bzdata). We recognize some folks may not be able to attend our session. That's why we're providing the information to the security community here. 


## What is The AI Cyber Guide?
The AI Cyber Guide leverages the power of AI to streamline incident response and enhance communication, ultimately saving time and building trust during critical situations.

### Key Features:
**GPT Logic for Prompt Recreation:**
- Customizable AI Prompts: Develop tailored AI prompts for diverse incident scenarios.
- Scenario-Based Suggestions: Generate intelligent prompts specific to each incident.

**Template for Incident Reporting:**
Incident Summary Template: Document incidents effectively with a structured approach for clear communication.


## Getting Started
We organized our Lab session in four parts:
1. Explore the difference in AI tools
2. Assume an identity and incident scenario
3. Assess if the incident is reportable in certain jurisdictions
4. Generate messages for specific audiences about this incident


Play with the different AI tools out there. Notice the difference between the generated output of free vs paid for tools.
Assume an identity with some scenario details. With the details, leverage AI to understand if this incident is reportable based on jurisdiction thresholds.
Then
